        <h1>Hello, Web!</h1>
        <p>My name is Connor Marshall (he/him)</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a senior at CU Boulder majoring in Marketing with a certificate in International Business and a minor in Creative Technology & Design.</p>
        <p>Before coming back to Colorado for college, I lived in Singapore for 7 years.</p>
        <p>A couple days ago, I realized I haven't built with legos since I was 10, so I bought one! My inner child is having the time of his life.</p>
        <h3>My Goals For Web</h3>
        <p>Since my main focuses are business and marketing, I see this class as a great way to build a foundation within web development, as I may use it for social media and marketing work in the future.</p>
        <p>I work as the head of video for Program Council, so I would also love to make my own site to host my portfolio.</p>
